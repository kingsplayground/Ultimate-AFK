# Ultimate-AFK
This plugin allows AFK players to be replaced by players who are in spectator, they can also be kicked from the server after a certain number of being detected as AFK (configurable).

# Features
- Detects AFK Players via in-game movement, camera movement
- Moves players to spectator after a determined AFK Time and grace period
- (Optional) Kick players from the server after repeated AFK detections!
- Custom broadcasts to AFK Players to indicate to them if they are AFK. 
- Works with SCP-079

# Permission
If you give a group the `uafk.ignore` permission the player will be ignored to replace a player and will also never be detected as AFK. Useful for administrators

# Installation
**This plugin only works in [NwPluginAPI](https://github.com/northwood-studios/NwPluginAPI)**

**You need [NWAPIPermissionSystem](https://github.com/CedModV2/NWAPIPermissionSystem) for this plugin to work.**

You can install this plugin using the command ``p install SrLicht/Ultimate-AFK`` on the console or by downloading the .dll file and placing it in ``SCP Secret Laboratory/PluginAPI/plugins/global or your port``

# For devs
You can disable a player from being detected as afk or using the command by setting ``uafk_disable`` in his TemporaryData.
```cs
// Add the temporary data
player.TemporaryData.StoredData.Add("uafk_disable", true);

// Remove the temporary data
player.TemporaryData.StoredData.Remove("uafk_disable");
// It is also cleaned at the end of a round or when a player is disconnected.
```
You can also prevent it from being detected as afk by adding the value ``uafk_disable_check``.
